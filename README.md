# Image_Classification

This is my Intro to Machine Learning course project based on Image Classification on the 2 datasets:
* UC merced Land Use dataset
* Cifar 10 dataset
</br>
The CIfar_DS303_Final.ipynb file consists of the CNN model and the results of the different classifications we did on the Cifar10 dataset.
The UcMerced_DS303_CNN.ipynb file consists of the classification done using image augmentation and training a CNN model. </br>
</br>
The image_classification_using_conv.ppt contains the workings of a CNN model, the datasets we used, how we pre-processed the data followed by training and testing the model. After that, it has the final accuracies of each model with their losses and accuracy graphs with the model summary.
